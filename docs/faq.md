## Which should I use `Expr(...)` or `'{...}`?
If you can write your code using `Expr(...)`, you will evaluate more at compile time.
Only use `'{...}` if you really need to evaluate the code later at runtime, usually because it depends on runtime values.

## Which is better between `Expr(true)` or `'{true}`?
All quotes containing a value of a primitive type is optimised to an `Expr.apply`.
Choose one in your project and stick with a single notation to avoid confusion.

## How do I get a value out of an `Expr`?
If the expression represents a value, you can use `.value`, `.valueOrError` or `Expr.unapply`

## How can I get the precise type of an `Expr`?
We can get the precise type (`Type`) of an `Expr` using the following pattern match:
```scala
val x: Expr[X] = ...
x match
  case '{ $x: t } =>
    // `x: Expr[X & t]` where `t` is the precise type of `x`
```
