# Quoted Code

A quoted code block `'{ ... }` is syntactacaly similar to a string quote `" ... "` with the diffecence that the fist contains typed code.
To insert a code into other code we use the `$expr` or `${ expr }` where `expr` is of type `Expr[T]`.
Intuitively, the code directly within the quote is not excecuted now, while the code within the splices is evaluated and their results are then spliced int the sourounding expression.

```scala
val msg = Expr("Hello")
val printHello = '{ print($hello) }
println(printHello.show) // print("Hello")
```

In general, the quote delays the excecution while the splice makes it happen before the sourounding code.
This generalization allows us to also give meeining to a `${ .. }` that is not within a quote, this evaluate the code within the splice at compile-time and place the result in the generated code.
Due to some thechincal considerations we only allow it directly within `inline` definitions that we call a [macro][macros].

It is possible to write a quote within a quote, but usually when we write macros we do not encounter such code.

## Level consitency
One cannot simple write any arbitrary code within quotes and within splices.
A part of the program will live at compile-time and the other will live at runtime.
Consider the folllowing ill-consturucted code.

```scala
def myBadCounter1(using QuoteContext): Expr[Int] = {
  var x = 0
  '{ x += 1; x }
}
```
The problem with this code is that `x` exists durring compilation, but then we try to use it after the compiler has finished (maybe even in another machine).
Clearly it would be impossible to access its value and update it.

Now consider the dual version, where we define the variable at runtime and try to access it at compile-time.
```scala
def myBadCounter2(using QuoteContext): Expr[Int] = '{
  var x = 0
  ${ x += 1; 'x }
}
```
Clearly, this should work as the variable does not exist yet.
To make sure you can only write programs that do not contain these kinds of probems we restrict the set of references to variable and other definitions.

We introduce _levels_ as a count of the number of quotes minus the number of splices surrounding an expression or definition.

```scala
// level 0
'{ // level 1
  var x = 0
  ${ // level 0
    x += 1 
    'x // level 1 
  }
}
```

The system will allow at any level references to global definitions such as `println`, but will restrict refrences to local definitions.
A local definition can only be accessed if it is defined a the same level as its reference.
This will catch the errors in `myBadCounter1` and `myBadCounter2`.

Eventhoug we cannot rever to variable inside of a quote, we can still pass its current value to it by lifting the value to an expression using `Expr.apply`.

## Liftables
The `Expr.apply` method uses intances of `Liftable` to perform the lifting.
```scala
object Expr:
  def apply[T](x: T)(using qctx: QuoteContext, lift: Liftable[T]): Expr[T] = lift.toExpr(x)
```

`Liftable` is defined as follows:
```scala
trait Liftable[T]:
  def toExpr(x: T): QuoteContext ?=> Expr[T]
```

The `toExpr` method will take a value `T` and generate code that will construct a copy of this value at runtime.

We can define our own `Liftable`s like:
```scala
given Liftable[Boolean] = new Liftable[Boolean] {
  def toExpr(x: Boolean) =
    if x then '{true}
    else '{false}
}

given Liftable[StringContext] = new Liftable[StringContext] {
  def toExpr(x: StringContext) =
    val parts = Varargs(stringContext.parts.map(Expr(_)))
    '{ StringContext($parts: _*) }
}
```
The `Varargs` constructor just creates an `Expr[Seq[T]]` which we can efficiently splice as a varargs.
In general any sequence can be spliced with `$mySeq: _*` to splice it a varargs.

## Quoted patterns
Quotes can also be used to check if an expression is equivalent to another or deconstruct an expression into it parts.


### Matching exact expression

The simples thing we can do is to check if an expression matches another know expression.
Bellow we show how we can match some expressions using `case '{...} =>`

```scala
def valueOfBoolean(x: Expr[Boolean])(using QuoteContext): Option[Boolean] =
  x match
    case '{ true } => Some(true)
    case '{ false } => Some(false)
    case _ => None

def valueOfBooleanOption(x: Expr[Option[Boolean]])(using QuoteContext): Option[Option[Boolean]] =
  x match
    case '{ Some(true) } => Some(Some(true))
    case '{ Some(false) } => Some(Some(false))
    case '{ None } => Some(None)
    case _ => None
```

### Matching partial expression

To make thing more compact, we can also match patially the expression using a `$` to match arbitrarry code and extract it.

```scala
def valueOfBooleanOption(x: Expr[Option[Boolean]])(using QuoteContext): Option[Option[Boolean]] =
  x match
    case '{ Some($boolExpr) } => Some(valueOfBoolean(boolExpr))
    case '{ None } => Some(None)
    case _ => None
```

### Matching types of expression

We can also match agains code of an arbitrarry type `T`.
Bellow we match agains `$x` of type `T` and we get out an `x` of type `Expr[T]`.

```scala
def exprOfOption[T: Type](x: Expr[Option[T]])(using QuoteContext): Option[Expr[T]] =
  x match
    case '{ Some($x) } => Some(x) // x: Expr[T]
    case '{ None } => Some(None)
    case _ => None
```

We can also check for the type of an expression

```scala
def valueOf(x: Expr[Any])(using QuoteContext): Option[Any] =
  x match
    case '{ $x: Boolean } => valueOfBoolean(x) // x: Expr[Boolean]
    case '{ $x: Option[Boolean] }  => valueOfBooleanOption(x) // x: Expr[Option[Boolean]]
    case _ => None
```
Or similarly for an some subexpression

```scala
case '{ Some($x: Boolean) } => // x: Expr[Boolean]
```

### Matching reciver of methods

When we want to match the reciver of a method we need to explicitly state its type

```scala
case '{ ($ls: List[Int]).sum } =>
```

If we would have written `$ls.sum` we would not have been able to know the type of `ls` and which `sum` method we are calling.

Another common case where we need type annotations is for infix operations.
```scala
case '{ ($x: Int) + ($y: Int) } =>
case '{ ($x: Double) + ($y: Double) } =>
case ...
```

## Unliftables

The `Expr.unlift`, `Expr.unlift.orError` `Unlifted.unapply` method uses intances of `Unliftable` to perform the unlifting.
```scala
extension [T](expr: Expr[T]):
  def unlift(using QuoteContext)(using unlift: Unliftable[T]): Option[T] =
    unlift(expr)

  def unliftOrError(using QuoteContext)(using unlift: Unliftable[T]): T =
    unlift(expr).getOrElse(eport.throwError("...", expr))
end extension

object Unlifted:
  def unapply[T](expr: Expr[T])(using QuoteContext)(using unlift: Unliftable[T]): Option[T] =
    unlift(expr)
```

`Unliftable` is defined as follows:
```scala
trait Unliftable[T]:
  def apply(x: Expr[T])(using QuoteContext): Option[T]
```

The `toExpr` method will take a value `T` and generate code that will construct a copy of this value at runtime.

We can define our own `Uniftable`s like:
```scala
given Unliftable[Boolean] = new Unliftable[Boolean] {
  def apply(x: Expr[Boolean])(using QuoteContext): Option[Boolean] =
    x match
      case '{ true } => Some(true)
      case '{ false } => Some(false)
      case _ => None
}

given Unliftable[StringContext] = new Unliftable[StringContext] {
  def apply(x: Expr[StringContext])(using qctx: QuoteContext): Option[StringContext] = x match {
    case '{ new StringContext(${Varargs(Consts(args))}: _*) } => Some(StringContext(args: _*))
    case '{     StringContext(${Varargs(Consts(args))}: _*) } => Some(StringContext(args: _*))
    case _ => None
  }
}
```
Note that we handled two cases for the `StringContext`.
As it is a `case class` it can be created with the `new StringContext` or with the `StringContext.apply` in the companion object.
We also used the `Varargs` extractor to match the arguments of type `Expr[Seq[String]]` into a `Seq[Expr[String]]`.
Then we used the `Consts` to match known constants in the `Seq[Expr[String]]` to get a `Seq[String]`.


## The QuoteContext
The `QuoteContext` is the main entry point for the creation of all quotes.
This contex is usually just passed around through contextual abstractions (`using` and `?=>`).
Each quote scope will provide have its own `QuoteContext`.
New scopes are intoduced each time a splice is intoduced `${...}`.
Though it looks like a splice takes an expression as argument, it actually takes a `QuoteContext ?=> Expr[T]`.
Therfore we could actually write it explicitly as `${ (using q) => ... }`, this might be useful when debuging to avoid generated names for these scopes.

When we write a top level splice in a macro we are calling something similar to the following definition.
This splice will provide the initial `QuoteContext` asociated with the macro expansion.
```scala
def $[T](x: QuoteContext ?=> Expr[T]): T = ...
```

When we have a splice within a quote, the inner quote context will depend on the outer one.
This link is represented using the `QuoteContext.Nested` type.
This relation tells us that it is safe to use expressions createed with `q1` within the scope of `q2` but not the other way around (this constraint is statically checked yet).

```scala
def f(using q1: QuoteContext) = '{
  ${ (using q2: q1.Nested) ?=>
      ...
  }
}
```

We can imagine that a nested splice is like the following method, where `ctx` is the context recived by the sourounding quote.
```scala
def $[T](using ctx: QuoteContext)(x: ctx.Nested ?=> Expr[T]): T = ...
```
